# Platform Game to learn piano

A simple platform game made in python and pygame in which the player can control the character with a piano via midi to learn to play difficult musical fragments in an enjoyable way. You can choose the sequence of notes you want to play like a pro!

### How to play it

If you have a piano, you can connect it to your computer using a USB cable. By default, you will play ascending and descending arpegios to go to right or left respectively and a chord to jump. The default starting scale is a D augmented scale but you can configure the way to move the character.

If you don't have a piano you can play it by using the left and right keys to move in thesee directions and the space bar to jump.
